# Multicollinearity

Multicollinearity exists whenever an independent variable is highly correlated with one or more of the other independent variables in a multiple regression equation. Multicollinearity is a problem because it undermines the statistical significance of an independent variable, reduces the precision of the estimated coefficients, and it affects the interpretability. In this notebook, p-value for coefficients of regression and Variance Inflation Factor are applied to detect and remove multicollinearity. Realistic and synthetic examples are presented.

Python functions and data files to run this notebook are in my [Github](https://github.com/MehdiRezvandehy/Multicollinearity.git) page.
